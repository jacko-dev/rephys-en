### A Repl.it collaboration project with the community, the site will teach people how to do things. 
___
Welcome to **_Rephys_**, Repl.it's educational experiments hosted by [@jacko-dev](https://github.com/jacko-dev) (or [@JacksonPhilips on Repl.it](https://repl.it/@JacksonPhilips)).

There are some rules you need to go over before requesting changes:

1. No trolling the code. This will result in a Permanent Ban.

2. No contribution will be given if done nothing.

3. Don't sware or say rude things.

4. Send a submission either via `repl.run` or a Website. All others will be declined.

5. Make it educational, do not just put it there only to not explain it.

6. Preferred categories are Math, Physics, and Web Development tutorials.

7. Contact me at [Repl.it](https://repl.it/@JacksonPhilips) for questions, put issues in the `Issues` area.

8. Have fun!
